# Phase 3 backend with Ruby

## Creation of a JSON API which is hosted on Heroku

- For this project I built a web basic API with Sinatra and Active Record to support a React
  frontend

## Phase 3 frontend repository
- https://github.com/JohnKamaujk/Project-Frontend

- With this app you can add, update, read and delete the desserts. The frontend listed above sends the requests and our ruby server sends back the dessert   or performs the CRUD operation sent in the client request

## Requirements

For this project, I used:

- Active Record to interact with a database.
- 5 models with a one-to-many relationship.
- API routes in Sinatra to get,post,delete & update
- Good OO design patterns.
